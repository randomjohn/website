# Exploratory data analysis

Exploratory data analysis is the art and science of discovering relationships in data. It employs techniques from data visualization, description, transformation, and modeling to generate questions and hypotheses about the processes underlying your data. Effective data visualization can show you relationships among several variables, and effective modeling can quantify those relationships.

# Rigorous predictive modeling

A rigorous predictive modeling approach can illuminate the power -- and the limitations -- of your data in decision making. Inform the optimal decision while guarding against overconfidence and bias.

# Reproducible analysis

Any analysis is ineffective if it isn't documented or reproducible. Document the reasons for each decision, no matter how small, to be able to reproduce every analysis and understand every decision even years later. This promotes reproducibility of code and thus the ability to improve future decisions. Modern tools encourage the intermingling of documentation and code so that reasoning for every decision is immediately available.

# Effective communication

When you have made your predictions and your decisions, chances are you have to justify your decisions to other stakeholders. Any good analytics workflow will account for the need to effectively communicate results either as a report or a presentation. Modern tools will even adjust reports and presentations as new data comes in.
