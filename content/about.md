# About me

I'm a statistician living in the Upstate SC area (Greenville/Spartanburg) with an interest in Bayesian methodology, machine learning, and open data. For over 15 years, I have designed and analyzed clinical trials, with an emphasis in oncology and neurology. I consult on data science projects using civic and open data. Finally, I participate in the Upstate Data Science and Analytics meetup.

# Description

I explore the acquisition, preparation, and analysis of data from public sources, especially data related to Greenville, South Carolina and the Upstate region. Hopefully this will inspire others to perform similar analyses and extend those analyses for Greenville and beyond.

The [Upstate Data Science and Analytics group](https://www.meetup.com/Greenville-Data-Science-Analytics-Meetup/) meets (mostly) monthly.
